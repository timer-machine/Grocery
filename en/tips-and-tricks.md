## Delete a step

Press the step and swipe it to the left or the right.

## Count up/Stopwatch

Add a "Halt" reminder to a step, and the step is a stopwatch. Move forward to the next step by manually tapping the next button.

## WearOS support

Add a "Notification" reminder to a step; Theoretically, the watch will remind you of the step.

## Indefinitely looping timer

Solution 1: Set the loop of a timer to a large number. Tens of thousands are usually enough.

Solution 2: Create a timer and save it. Reedit it and tap the gear icon at the left of the timer name. Turn on "After the timer finishes, start" and set it to itself. Now the timer will loop forever.

## Tweak time quickly

After enabling [Advanced Time Tweak] in the app settings, in the timer screen, you can tweak time by just pressing the tweak button, moving the finger to a time and releasing the finger. This is quicker than tapping twice.
